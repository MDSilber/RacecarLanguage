Agenda for meeting on 2/20/13 with TA

1. clarify roles (particularly system integrator and system architect)

2. ideas for language lessons (in order of decreasing resemblance to normal languages)

  a. standard CS style lessons like sorting, print an array, calculate change for a payment, etc. in a kid-friendly scenario (like candy)

  b. kid-friendly lessons like number of ways to share toys, who wins at a game of dice (write the game w/ help from library functions), how much candy can you buy with $x.

  c. a game, such as navigating a grid with obstacles, with different levels, where you play by coding a correct route. <-- closer to the line of application vs. programming language

3. language to write it in: ocaml for complier but not necessarily for compiler output (e.g. could translate to python)
