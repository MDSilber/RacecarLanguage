 -    This program should make the car drive in (approximately) a figure 8
 -    like the following (from the start point, then SE, NE, SE again, SW, 
 -    then NW, and finally SW again to end up at the start point):
 -
 -                          *           *         |         N 
 -                        *   *       *   *       |         ^
 -   start &            *       *   *       *     |         |
 - finish here ---->  *           *           *   |   W <-- * --> E
 -                  \   *       *   *       *     |         |
 -                    \   *   *       *   *       |         v
 -                      \   *           *         |         S

:) Turn  45 degrees right (If grid is a map, then toward southeast)
turn right

:) Drive the first side of the '8'
print "Starting out southeast... "
drive forward 10

:) Turn wheels 90 degrees left to northeast and drive the next straight: 
turnNinetyDegrees "left"
print "now heading northeast... "
drive forward 20

:) Complete the rest of the '8'
turnNinetyDegrees "right"
print "going southeast again... "
drive forward 10

turnNinetyDegrees "right"
print "now heading southwest again... "
drive forward 10

turnNinetyDegrees "right" 
print "going northwest for the long stretch ..."
drive forward 20

turnNinetyDegrees "left"
print "and southwest for the final side!"
drive forward 10
