comments on what it was like to write in my language:

I don't think I need an end-of-statement character, but if we use one I would recommend a period. then we'd have to be careful when using floats (myFloat becomes 1.5.)

I tried to avoid parentheses, and punctuation in general. I know they're necessary to some extent.

loops: foreach (I called it for) and while, maybe also an until.

method invocation: do method on parameter1 and parameter2 ..... could use improvement

I like using the word "is" as boolean equals, but I also use it to declare variables as "is a" which could present a parsing complication.

Comments are smileys. Obviously that's subject to change but I like them the way they are.

Not whitespace sensitive except for newlines

I'm looking for another word/phrase other than "done with" to close statement blocks.

I'm thinking of requiring loops and if statements to operate only on functions (which could be defined anonymously) somewhat like the following:

for i going from 1 to 10, repeat myFunc

or

for i going from 1 to 10, repeat procedure which does
        :) method body
        
end procedure

but that probably needs some syntax improvement
