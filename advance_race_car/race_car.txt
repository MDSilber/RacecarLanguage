:-( The goal is to steer around the edge of a map and to stop at the initial point the car began to go around the edge 


conditional statements edit?
change make to define?

:-)

make main
{
    move around track
}

make turn using direction(word)
{
    steer direction
    drive forward 1
    steer straight
}

:-( assume car starts off pointing north.
    turn left and go to the western edge of the map
    hug the edge, turning to accommodate non-straight edges
:-)
make move around track
{

    :) go to the edge of the board (left side) 

    if can move left
    {
        turn left
    }
    repeat if can move forward
    {
        drive forward 1
    }

    :) remember the original position so you know when to stop
    set original_position to get car position

    :) start to go around the board counter-clockwise

    turn left

    repeat if get car position is not original_position
    {
        :) try to stay next to the boundary
        if can move right
        {
            turn right
        }
        else if can move straight
        {
            :) drive forward 1 is given after all of the conditionals
        }
        else if can move left
        {
            turn left
        }
        else
        {
            :) error
        }
        drive forward 1
    }
}
